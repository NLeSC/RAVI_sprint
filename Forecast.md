# Harvest Forecast

URL: [Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/946947/schedule/projects/1594697?showDrawer=true)

## Conlcusion

No match

## Test results

Forecast is planning, nice interface
Harvest = exact / past (with many features, and compulsory timewriting)

So double pricing... too expensive

## Comments
Positive points:
 * interface easy and smooth
 * utilization per person and project

Negative points:
 * rest of statistics in the Harvest app.
 * minimum resolution in overviews is a day when looking at 'months'.
