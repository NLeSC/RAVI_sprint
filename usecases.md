Project Coordinator usecases
- Which project will start / start soon, etc
  We cannot filter in projects to do this
  There is no indication of project start in this view at the moment either

- How are my projects occupied, by which people and for how many hours per week?
  Yes by which people. But how many hours is hard to tell because mouse over shows cumulative (or incorrect) values where it shouldn't.

- Are the hours of my project being used at the right speed?
  Plot on project details does exactly that.

- Seeks engineers for a new project
  Cannot query. You would have to scroll. Scrolling gives insight quicklly but not ideal. Also the plots are a bit vague with the dotted bars seeming to indicate the number of available hours but not everyone has such a bar drawn for them.

- We employ people with the right skills
  Not There

- Opening and closing projects
  Opening a project works but doesn't refresh the page. Changing end dates works fine (again without refresh though).
